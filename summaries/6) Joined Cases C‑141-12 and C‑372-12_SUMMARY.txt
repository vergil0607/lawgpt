7 Article 14 o f the dir ective p rovides that Member States are to grant the da ta subject the right, i n 
certain circumstances, to object to the processing of data relating to him. 11 Under Article 43(e) of the W bp, the controller can exclude application o f Article 35 o f the W bp in so 
far as is necessary in the interests of protecting the data subject or the rights and freedoms of others. 15 Depending on th e case, the legal analysis may be more or less extensive, varying from a f ew sentences 
to several pages. A s ummary analysis may me rely refer to th e application o f a 
particular policy line. 16 Until 14 July 2009 , the Minister’s policy was to make th e minute available upon me re request. 17 Since then, requests for the communication o f minutes have b een systematically refused. Case C -141/12
18 On 13 January 2009 , YS submitted an application f or a r esidence pe rmit for a f ixed pe riod under 
asylum law. That decision w as withdrawn by 
letter of 9 April 2010 , and the application w as on ce again rejected by decision o f 6 July 2010 . 19 By letter of 10 September 2010 , YS asked for the minute relating to the decision o f 6 July 2010 t o be 
communicated to him. However, the decision did g ive a s ummary of the 
data contained in th e minute, the origin of those da ta and th e bodies to which th e da ta had b een 
disclosed. YS lodged an objection a gainst the refusal to communicate th e minute, which itself was 
rejected by decision o f 22 March 2011 . 24 By letter of 30 October 2009 , M, on th e basis of Article 35 o f the W bp, requested access to the minute 
relating to that decision. 34 Although all interested parties who ad opted a v iew on th is point consider that the da ta relating to the 
applicant for a r esidence pe rmit included in th e minute correspond to th e concept of ‘personal data’ 
and propose, consequently, that a p ositive r eply be given to th e first question i n Case C-141/12, 
opinions differ in relation to the legal analysis in that administrative d ocument, which is the subject of 
the second question in that case and the fifth question in Case C-372/12. 8 ECLI:EU:C:2014 :2081JUDGMENT O F17.7.2014 —JOINEDCASESC-141/12 A ND C-372/12
YS AND OTHERS
35 YS, M a nd S, the Greek, Au strian and Portuguese Governments and th e European C ommission 
consider that, in so far as the legal analysis refers to a s pecific natural person a nd is based on th e 
situation a nd th at pe rson’s individual characteristics, it also comes under the concept of ‘personal 
data’. 37 In th is respect, it should be no ted th at Article 2(a) of Directive 95 /46 d efines pe rsonal data as ‘any 
information r elating to an identified or identifiable natural person’. That finding 
applies equally to D irective 95 /46, which, i n essence, has th e same o bjective a s Regulation 
No 45/2001 . They maintain that only such a c opy would 
allow him to ensure that he is in possession o f all the personal data which concern him in the minute. 60 It follows from th e foregoing considerations that the answer to th e third a nd fifth q uestions in Case 
C-141/12 a nd the first and second questions in Case C-372/12 is that Article 12(a) of Directive 95 /46 
and Article 8(2) of the Ch arter must be interpreted as me aning that an applicant for a r esidence permit 
has a ri ght o f access to all pe rsonal da ta concerning him w hich ar e processed by th e national 
administrative a uthorities within th e me aning of Article 2(b) of that dir ective. 62 The Commission c onsiders that those questions are inadmissible on a ccount of their hypothetical and 
obscure wording. 67 It is clear from th e wording of Article 41 o f the Ch arter that it is addr essed no t to the Member States 
but solely to the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the European Union (see, to that effect, the 
judgment in Cicala, C-482/10, EU:C:2011 :868, paragraph 28). Costs
70 Since th ese proceedings are, for the parties to th e main proceedings, a s tep in th e action pe nding 
before th e referring court, th e decision on c osts is a m atter for th at court. C osts incurred in 
submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are no t recoverable.
