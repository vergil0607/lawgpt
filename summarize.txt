Scientists say they have discovered a new species of orangutans on Indonesia’s island of Sumatra. The population differs in several ways from the two existing orangutan species found in Sumatra and the neighboring island of Borneo. Orangutan – which means person of the forest in the Indonesian and Malay languages - is the world’s biggest tree-living mammal. That is because the environment which they depend on is greatly threatened by development. There is no unified international system for recognizing new species. In addition, the writers of the study are recommending that plans for a hydropower center in the area be stopped by the government.
